# Android Google Play Store Readiness

## Status: Not Ready — 3 Blockers, 5 Recommended Fixes

## Analysis Date: 2026-04-28

---

## Blockers (must fix before submission)

### 1. No App Icons
**Severity: Critical — instant rejection**

The `mipmap-hdpi/`, `mipmap-xhdpi/`, `mipmap-xxhdpi/` directories are empty. No launcher icon exists in any density.

**Required:**
- `ic_launcher.png` in mdpi (48x48), hdpi (72x72), xhdpi (96x96), xxhdpi (144x144), xxxhdpi (192x192)
- Adaptive icon support (Android 8.0+): `ic_launcher_foreground.xml` + `ic_launcher_background.xml` in `mipmap-anydpi-v26/`
- Round icon variant: `ic_launcher_round.png` in all densities

**How to fix:**
- Design a launcher icon (or use Android Studio's Image Asset Studio)
- Generate all density variants
- Place in `src/OpenChat.Android/Resources/mipmap-*/`
- Update `AndroidManifest.xml` if icon references differ from default

### 2. Version Code Hardcoded to 1
**Severity: Critical — blocks updates**

`src/OpenChat.Android/OpenChat.Android.csproj` has `ApplicationVersion` set to `1`. Google Play requires a strictly increasing version code for each APK/AAB upload. If published with `1`, the next update must be `2`, etc.

**Current config:**
```xml
<ApplicationVersion>1</ApplicationVersion>
<ApplicationDisplayVersion>0.5.0</ApplicationDisplayVersion>
```

**How to fix:**
- Auto-increment version code in CI/CD (e.g., use build number from GitHub Actions)
- Or set manually before each release: `<ApplicationVersion>$(BUILD_NUMBER)</ApplicationVersion>`
- Display version should follow semver: `1.0.0` for first Play Store release

### 3. No Data Extraction Rules (Android 12+)
**Severity: High — Play Console warning**

Apps targeting SDK 31+ should declare `android:dataExtractionRules` in the manifest. This controls what data is eligible for cloud backup and device-to-device transfer.

For a privacy-focused encrypted messaging app, this should be restrictive — MLS keys and encrypted messages should NOT be backed up (they're device-specific and won't work on a new device).

**How to fix:**
- Create `src/OpenChat.Android/Resources/xml/data_extraction_rules.xml`:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<data-extraction-rules>
    <cloud-backup>
        <exclude domain="database" path="." />
        <exclude domain="sharedpref" path="." />
        <exclude domain="file" path="OpenChat/" />
    </cloud-backup>
    <device-transfer>
        <exclude domain="database" path="." />
        <exclude domain="file" path="OpenChat/" />
    </device-transfer>
</data-extraction-rules>
```
- Add to manifest: `android:dataExtractionRules="@xml/data_extraction_rules"`

## Recommended Fixes (strongly advised before launch)

### 4. No Crash Reporting
**Severity: High**

The app has file-based logging (Serilog) and a built-in log viewer, but no remote crash reporting. If the app crashes in production, there's no way to know unless the user manually exports logs.

**Options:**
- Firebase Crashlytics (free, Google's standard)
- Sentry (.NET SDK available, privacy-friendly — can self-host)
- App Center (Microsoft, being retired — avoid)

**Recommendation:** Sentry — it has a .NET SDK, can be self-hosted for privacy, and doesn't require Google Play Services. Firebase Crashlytics requires Google Play Services which some privacy-conscious users may not have.

**Effort:** 1-2 days

### 5. No Deep Links for Nostr URIs
**Severity: Medium**

The app handles `bunker://` URLs via manual paste in the login screen but doesn't register as a handler for these URI schemes. Users can't tap a `bunker://` link in another app and have OpenChat open.

**Missing intent-filters for:**
- `bunker://` — NIP-46 signer connection (Amber interop)
- `nostrconnect://` — alternative NIP-46 scheme
- `nostr:npub1...` — user profile links (future)
- `nostr:note1...` — note/event links (future)

**How to fix:**
Add to `AndroidManifest.xml` inside the `<activity>` tag:
```xml
<intent-filter>
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
    <data android:scheme="bunker" />
</intent-filter>
<intent-filter>
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
    <data android:scheme="nostrconnect" />
</intent-filter>
```

Then handle the intent data in `MainActivity.OnNewIntent()`.

**Effort:** 1-2 days

### 6. No Splash Screen
**Severity: Medium**

Android 12+ has a mandatory system splash screen (SplashScreen API). Without explicit configuration, the system uses a default white screen with the app icon (which doesn't exist — see blocker #1). This creates a poor first impression.

**How to fix:**
- Add AndroidX SplashScreen dependency
- Configure splash theme in `styles.xml` with `windowSplashScreenBackground` and `windowSplashScreenAnimatedIcon`
- Apply splash theme to the activity in manifest

**Effort:** 0.5-1 day (after icons exist)

### 7. Use Modern Photo Picker (Android 13+)
**Severity: Low**

The app uses `ActivityResultContracts.GetContent()` for media selection. Android 13+ introduced `PickVisualMedia()` which provides a better UX and doesn't require `READ_MEDIA_*` permissions.

**How to fix:**
- Use `ActivityResultContracts.PickVisualMedia()` on Android 13+
- Fall back to `GetContent()` on older versions
- Remove `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES` permission if only using the new picker

**Effort:** 0.5 day

### 8. Predictive Back Gesture (Android 13+)
**Severity: Low**

Android 13+ supports predictive back animations that show a preview of where the back gesture will navigate. Not implementing this won't block submission but the app won't feel native.

**How to fix:**
- Add `android:enableOnBackInvokedCallback="true"` to manifest
- Use `OnBackPressedDispatcher` instead of `OnBackPressed()` override
- Test back navigation in all fragments

**Effort:** 1 day

## What's Already Production-Ready

### Permissions & Security
- All permissions properly declared in manifest with correct `maxSdkVersion` fallbacks
- Runtime permission requests for camera, microphone, storage (granular Android 13+)
- POST_NOTIFICATIONS permission for Android 13+
- `allowBackup="false"` — correct for a privacy-focused app
- No hardcoded secrets, API keys, or test credentials anywhere in the codebase
- Keys stored in Android Keystore (AES-GCM encryption)
- SQLite database encrypted at rest via `EncryptedSqliteStorageProvider`

### Build & Signing
- Release keystore exists: `openchat-release.keystore`
- Signing config uses environment variables (not hardcoded passwords)
- Package name: `com.openchat.app` (proper format)
- Target framework: `net9.0-android` (current)
- Min SDK: API 24 (Android 7.0) — covers ~97% of devices

### Background Service
- `RelayForegroundService` properly implemented with persistent notification
- Foreground service type declared: `ForegroundServiceType.TypeDataSync`
- Notification channel created with appropriate importance level
- Wake lock for connection persistence
- Can be toggled on/off by user in Settings

### Privacy Posture (strong for Play Store data safety form)
- No analytics or telemetry
- No device identifiers collected
- No location data
- No third-party tracking SDKs
- All messages end-to-end encrypted (MLS protocol)
- User controls relay selection (data routing)
- External signer support (private keys can stay off-device entirely)

## Play Store Admin Tasks (non-code)

### Data Safety Form
Google Play requires a data safety declaration. For OpenChat:

| Data Type | Collected | Shared | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|--------|---------|
| User ID (public key) | Yes | Yes (relays) | Core functionality |
| Messages | Yes | Yes (relays, encrypted) | Core functionality |
| Media files | Optional | Optional (Blossom server) | User-initiated sharing |
| Contacts (following list) | Optional | Optional (relays) | Social features |
| App logs | Yes (local only) | No | Diagnostics |

Encryption: In transit (WSS/TLS) + at rest (MLS + SQLite encryption)
Data deletion: User can delete all data by clearing app data

### Store Listing Assets Required
- Feature graphic: 1024x500 px
- Phone screenshots: minimum 2, recommended 4-8 (1080x1920 or similar)
- Tablet screenshots: recommended if supporting tablets
- Short description: max 80 characters
- Full description: max 4000 characters
- Privacy policy URL: **required** (must be hosted publicly)

### Content Rating
Complete the IARC questionnaire in Play Console:
- App category: Communication / Messaging
- User-generated content: Yes (messages, but E2EE so not moderatable)
- Expected rating: likely Teen (13+) or Everyone (depending on questionnaire answers)
- Note: E2EE messaging without content moderation may trigger additional review

### Privacy Policy
**Required for Play Store.** Must cover:
- What data is collected (public keys, encrypted messages, optional media)
- How data is transmitted (to user-selected Nostr relays over WSS)
- Encryption practices (MLS E2EE, at-rest encryption)
- User rights (full control over data, can delete by clearing app)
- Third-party services (Nostr relays, Blossom media servers — user-configured)
- Contact information

## Recommended Implementation Order

1. **App icons** (blocker #1) — must do first, everything else depends on having icons
2. **Data extraction rules** (blocker #3) — 30 minutes, XML file + manifest attribute
3. **Version code auto-increment** (blocker #2) — CI/CD change
4. **Splash screen** (fix #6) — depends on icons
5. **Deep links** (fix #5) — improves Amber/signer interop
6. **Crash reporting** (fix #4) — important for production monitoring
7. **Modern photo picker** (fix #7) — low effort polish
8. **Predictive back** (fix #8) — lowest priority polish
